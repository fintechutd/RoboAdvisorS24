        Market volatility can cause uncertainty and fear. Risk tolerance is how comfortable you are during volatile times, when market swings can dramatically change the value of your investments. This is another key factor in finding the right asset mix. Taking on more risk can lead to higher returns, but it can also result in substantial losses.
